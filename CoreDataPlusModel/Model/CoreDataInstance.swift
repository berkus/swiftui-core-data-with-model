 This is based on code here https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/650876?answerId=620207022#620207022
  except I've removed the both the lazy var and singleton stuff as I don't think either of those are
  necessary when the the object is instantiated via the @StateObject as this:
  1. Causes instantiation just before the view that it is contained in is rendered => use of lazy is not needed
  2. Is only created one within the hierarchy that it is used in => no need for singleton stuff
